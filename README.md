- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoanGitHubUser. I'm from Barcelona (Spain), I am 54, and after some years I re-start again in the Linux world, with a fresh 
  ElementaryOS Linux dist installed on a MacBook Pro 15" Retina from 2.012.
- 👀 I’m interested on Technology, Hardware and all kind of OSes, Linux and free software in general. I am a Mac user, so I am curious if I could 
  migrate all of my needs into Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in the basics of install and configure Linux, and fighting with the drivers install problems. After that I will start 
with the file structure, how the modules starts etc. Currently only using Office and Music Apps, and not developing. A little fan of Steam too :-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding bugs of apps, specially the ElementaryOS Apps
- 📫 You can rech me by mail

  Thank you all
